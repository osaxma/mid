TODOs:
- [ ] Support returning stream
    - This will require some websocket shenanigans 
- [ ] configuration
    - e.g. formatted code width 

- [ ] Interceptors client side
- [ ] http client on client side
    - Should we use http.post directly
    - or create a single client? (if so, see: https://github.com/dart-lang/http/issues/422)
