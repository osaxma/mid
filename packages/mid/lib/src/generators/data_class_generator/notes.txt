- To make it easy for the user, we can generate the serialization for both client and server. 

the user only have to create a class definition such as:

class User {
    final int id;
    final String firstName;
    final String lastName;

    @serverOnly 
    final String hashedPassword; 

    User({required this.id, required this.firstName, required this.lastName});
}


Only issue if the user wants to have specific key/value for serialization (e.g. saving to dabase where convention is snake_case)
Though this option can be added as a configuration. 

Also the serialization logic can be generated apart from the class (a function for instance) or extending the class and creating a separate one in another file.
