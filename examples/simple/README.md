# Simple Example

This folder contains three parts:
- backend 
    this contains the server where the backend code is written.
- client (generated)
    this entire folder is generated by `mid`
- frontend
    this is just a simple flutter project that imports `client` to commmunicate with server. 



To run the example, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/osaxma/mid.git 
```

to avoid a bunch of warning and not having to run `dart packages get` for every folder, make sure to open the example only on your IDE:

```
code mid/examples/simple
```

You still need to run `dart pub get` within both `backend` and `client` folders & `flutter packages get` within `frontend` folder. 


Once done, run the server:

```
dart run backend/bin/main.dart
```

Then run the frontend:

```
cd frontend
flutter run -d chrome 
```
